# For variable names and method names use snake_case, like following:

first_name = "Matheus" # this_is_a_good_variable_name

def full_name(f_name, l_name) # this_is_a_good_method_name
end

# methods that ends with ? returns true / false

# A method that ends with ! is a destructive method, so it overwrites the
# value of the object (usually inside a variable) on which it was called
